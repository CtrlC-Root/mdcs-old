# Roadmap

This file contains high-level items. Please see the respective `README.md` files in each package for
package-specific items.

- [ ] Unit testing.
- [ ] Integration testing?
- [ ] Support for running actions.
- [ ] Access control:
  - [ ] Generic backend framework in `libmdcs-python`.
  - [ ] JWT implementation?

In general the documentation could always be improved as well. It doesn't do a great job of
introducing new users to all of the relevant concepts necessary to understand the control system
architecture.
